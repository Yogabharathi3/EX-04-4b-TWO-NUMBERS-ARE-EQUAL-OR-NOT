# EX-04-4b-TWO-NUMBERS-ARE-EQUAL-OR-NOT
## AIM 
Write a C Program to check whether the two numbers are equal or not using 
simple if statement. 
## ALGORITHM 
1. Start the program. 
2. Read two numbers. 
3. If first number is equal to second number, display both are equal. 
4. Otherwise display both are not equal. 
5. Stop the program. 
## PROGRAM 
```
#include<stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
 int a,b; 
 scanf("%d%d",&a,&b); 
 if(a==b) 
 { 
 printf("Numbers are Equal"); 
 } 
 else 
 { 
 printf("Numbers are not Equal"); 
 } 
}
```
